                    Given that most small and medium-sized farms lack the financial
                    and operational resources to become certified, we have
                    established an independent non-profit organization, the
                    Sustainable Floral Fund (SFF), to provide technical assistance
                    to farms seeking certification. SFF will be financed through
                    contributions from KaBloom as well as other industry players,
                    government agencies, and non-profits.

                  <p>
                    Sustainably-Certified farms must meet the basic labor conditions
                    set out by the ILO and national laws to ensure safe, healthy,
                    and equitable work environments. Certified farms adhere to
                    maximum working hours and promote worker training and
                    development. They are also encouraged to provide social security
                    coverage and support local communities through a variety of
                    initiatives, such as local purchasing, hiring, and
                    infrastructure improvements. Given that women make up the vast
                    majority of farm workers, certified farms are also required to
                    protect the rights of women and mothers.

                  <p>
                    Sustainably-Certified farms must reduce the environmental impact
                    of cut flower farming by encouraging growers to implement
                    efficient and sustainable farming techniques focused on reducing
                    pesticide use, conserving water, and sustaining healthy
                    ecosystems. Certified farms must implement pest control
                    practices that minimize environmental harm, including avoiding
                    the use of banned chemicals and reducing the use of dangerous
                    chemical product through alternative pest control and
                    fertilization practices. Farms are also encouraged to conserve
                    natural resources by implementing water efficient irrigation
                    technologies, monitoring and optimizing water usage, and
                    implementing other environmentally-sustainable practices around
                    energy use, greenhouse gas reduction, and product packaging.
                    Finally, certified farms are encouraged to take steps to protect
                    wildlife and habitat; provide safe storage, handling, and
                    disposal of chemicals; and recycle or compost waste when
                    possible.
