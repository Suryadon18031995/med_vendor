                                            you may, on occasion, experience problems due to the perishable nature of the fresh
                                            product. If for any reason this should happen, please refer to the following guidelines
                                when requesting credit.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Inspect your product as soon as it arrives. This is extremely important.</li>
                                            <li>Report any problems to your salesperson or customer service representative via
                                                email within as soon as possible but in no case in more than 24 hours of receiving
                                                the product. Please be complete in your description of the problem. Note if the box
                                                appeared damaged when received. This information is essential so we advance the
                                    credit request back to the farm or carrier.</li>
                                            <li>Please provide digital photos of the damaged product that you are requesting credit
                                    for.</li>

                                            <li>Group photo of all products you are requesting credit on. For example If you are

                                            <li>Unfortunately under our agreements with the farms, we cannot process credit requests
                                    received after 24 hours from delivery or that do not follow the above requirements.</li>
